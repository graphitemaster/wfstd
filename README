This is the C++ library I wrote while working for Wayforward.

It implements the following containers:

    - wfArray
    - wfList
    - wfMap
    - wfPair
    - wfSet
    - wfSingleList
    - wfSmallList
    - wfStackList
    - wfVector

Each of these containers being highly tuned for their specified use.
In addition to those containers there exists some classes for manipulating
the contents of those containers:

    - wfAlgorithm
    - wfSorter
    - wfFunctional

In addition there is memory management facilities. No container uses
global new / delete operators instead there exists a trivial wfHeap
class in wfStandard.h which you can map to any memory management system
you'd like. In addition there are a few memory related classes:

    - wfSharedPointer
    - wfNullPointer

There exists a highly-optimized math library that can take
advantage of AltiVec, Neon, SSE and auto vectorization if they're
present, otherwise it fallbacks to scalar operations. The math components
are exposed as:
    - wfMat4
    - wfVector2f
    - wfVector3f
    - wfVector4f


Finally there is some miscellaneous components:
    - wfTypeTraits.h:
        Contains some template meta-programming facilities.
    - wfSystemInfo.h
        Contains functions for obtaining information about system
        features, e.g SSE/AltiVec/Neon tests.
